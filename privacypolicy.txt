3. Minimal IP-Based Location Lookup
When you visit our website, a request is made to the external service ipapi.co to determine the country from which you are accessing the site. This is used exclusively to customize product links (e.g., to show country-specific Amazon links).

No personal data such as names or precise location is collected.
We do not store any IP addresses ourselves.

According to ipapi.coâ€™s privacy practices, they may process the IP address temporarily to determine the approximate country but do not store it permanently on our behalf.


4. Use of Amazon as a Third-Party Provider
This website participates in the Amazon EU Associates Program. Amazon may use cookies to track orders made through affiliate links.

We do not receive or process any personal data from these affiliate partners.

This website does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics tools. Your visit is not tracked or analyzed beyond the anonymous country lookup described in section 3.
